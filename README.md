# OpenGL-2D-River-Game
This project is a simple 2D game developed using OpenGL. The aim of the game is to navigate a star across three rivers using rotating boats. The star can move forward and must avoid falling into the river by timing its movements with the boats. The game includes basic graphics, keyboard controls, and simple collision detection.
